# push_swap
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

Algorithm inspired by [Mia Combeau's implementation](https://github.com/mcombeau/push_swap)

We developed two kinds of tests: \

1. [One that consists of a competition among any chosen push_swap projects](https://github.com/gfantonib/push_swap_battery_tester.git) \
2. [A tester built considering the PDF and the evaluation page](https://github.com/gfantonib/push_swap_evaluator.git)
